### Hi, I'm Nathan :wave:

I'm a senior software engineer with a focus on backend systems and full-stack product development. I've led projects in Rust, Go, and TypeScript, shipping scalable cloud-based applications.

**Tech specialties:**
- Rust, Go, TypeScript, React
- System design, clean architecture, performance
- Cloud-native apps (AWS, Linux), optimized for speed, reliability, and user experience

**Domain interests:**
- AgTech, FinTech, and tools that empower small teams
- High-performance backend systems and thoughtful UX
- The modern tech renaissance: AI, crypto, clean energy (esp. nuclear + solar), open protocols and space exploration as drivers of human freedom and progress

**Outside of work:**
- Organic farming
- Electronics, microcontroller and Raspberry Pi projects
- Brazil :brazil: and Luxembourg :luxembourg:

**I care about:**
- Building fast, reliable systems with clean abstractions.
- Ownership and clarity across the stack--from code to infra.
